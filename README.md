# Student Tracker Prep
This project aims to make it easier to process Slate data for clearinghouse StudentTracker (<a href="https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/colleges/studenttracker/">If you are unfamiliar with StudentTracker you can learn more about it here</a>). StudentTracker is a little finicky about how data is loaded into it, so it is important that attention is paid to make sure all requirements are met. Fortunately, this repo has everything you need to make this process as painless as possible.

## Step 1: Slate Query
Start by building a Slate query with the following exports. Note that these exact exports must be used, but you may use whatever filters you need.

<ul>
  <li>Application/Student ID</li>
  <li>First Name</li>
  <li>Middle Name</li>
  <li>Last Name</li>
  <li>Suffix</li>
  <li>Birhdate</li> 
  <li>Search date (application submitted date)</li>
</ul>
